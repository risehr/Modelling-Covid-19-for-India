While running the COVID_19_CODE.ipynb, the results can be varying depending upon the current situations in India. We have tried our best to predict the results as far as in a realistic manner. The graphs demonstrates huge populations and hence should be expanded and zoomed to a very large extent to notice the differences or conclude the observations.

This project is purely based upon the Indian context. The data was researched and referred from the Indian ministries concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project was kind of a research paper and was executed by 3 team members. The names of the team members is written on the Modelling Covid-19 for India.pdf.
